When a clinical siteâ€™s PT department agrees to provide clinical instruction, there are several aspects that go into the process and planning stages.  The first step is for the CCCE to complete the APTA Clinical Site Information Form (CSIF).  This form can be sent electronically or by hard copy to the ACCE/DCE for review. You can save this electronic version and send it to any PT or PTA program that requires it-it is a national CSIF form.
