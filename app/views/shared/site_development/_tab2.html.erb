The APTA has created a repository for CSIF forms (apta.org) and you can upload them directly to that data bank.  However, programs must PAY to access these CSIF forms-they are not made available to the schools without a yearly fee. At this time, the PT Programs in Texas do not subscribe to this process. So please note that if you upload this form to the APTA website, Texas PT programs will not be able to access it.
