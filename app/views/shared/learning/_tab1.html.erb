Please complete the Clinical Teaching survey which contains items that have been identified as characteristics of clinical teachers. Please rate yourself on each item. This will help you develop a self assessment profile of your clinical teaching. Print a blank copy of the survey and rate yourself again in 6 months (or after 2-3 students). Note areas of improvement and areas to work on. Clinical teaching is a learning process, too!
