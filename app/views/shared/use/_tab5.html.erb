The progress report consists of the narrative, the summary of ratings on all skills, and a Visual Analog Scale. As mentioned previously, the narrative can be documented in bullet format. The Progress Report gives a summary of the ENTIRE clinical experience. Each skill that was worked on and the ratings received are reported on the Progress Report. The Progress Report is returned to the ACCE/DCE. The academic institution keeps the Progress Report on file for several reasons. First, it is a legal document that reflects the studentâ€™s clinical experience. Second, if a student were to lose the PT MACS (yes, it does happen sometimes), the ACCE/DCE will have the records of the student performance. The last portion of the Progress Report is the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). This is where the CI rates the student on the current level of performance and in comparison to an entry-level clinician. You must think about these ratings in order to make them valid. You will have some level of preconceived acceptable clinical performance prior to your student beginning the rotation. Did the student meet, fall below or surpass those expectations? The answer to this question will dictate how you rate the student on the VAS. The second rating is your perception of how this student performs in comparison to an entry-level clinician. Now think about this. If your student is on the first clinical experience and still has two or three rotations to go and several more academic semesters, would you consider that student as an entry-level clinician? The student may be entry level for your setting, so your answer may be yes. The point of this information is to get you to really think about where you place your hash mark on the line and not just place it arbitrarily. Believe it or not, the academic institution uses these ratings in correlation studies and other research.
