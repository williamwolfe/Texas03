The audience isn’t always in the right frame of mind, however, to actually hear what we have to say; to participate in the communication process. If the goal of communicating is to get across an idea, a thought, a suggestion, a compromise, a message, then it is the speaker’s job to consider all the factors that impact the communication process and to make sure that all necessary preparations have taken place, so that the listener is prepared to not only listen, but to hear.
