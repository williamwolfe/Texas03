  Much of what we discuss is applicable to communication among colleagues, from the physical therapist to the physician, from the PT to the OT, etc. However, our primary focus in this session, is in situations with the PT/PTA student and the Clinical Instructor. Although much of communication between CI and student is to provide feedback, this process is not always easy.
